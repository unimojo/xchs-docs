# How to 'Burn' It

Certainly you won't want to burn it, so here is the guide how you might burn it and try to avoid them.

- `transfer` XCHS funds to CAT address.
    - It's burned, and lost forever.
    - Someone might get used to copy addresses from blockchain explorer, but please never copy the CAT address.
- `transfer` XCHS funds to random central exchange.
    - It depends, it might be dangerous.
    - Until safe exchange protocol like offer or DEX is introduced, trading without any trust could prove perilous.



# Safe Scenarios

Here listed some safe scenarios:

- Moving all XCH out of the account address.
    - 🛡️ It's safe.
    - You might need move some XCH back into this account to extract out these XCHS funds later.
- Inscribing a wrong inscription.
    - 🛡️ It's safe.
    - The catch is, this could end up being ineffective.
- Inscribing the `deploy` more than once or after someone already deployed the same tick.
    - 🛡️ It's safe.
    - But the later one have no impact. The limit or supply won't change since the very first deploy.
