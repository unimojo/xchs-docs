# Deploy

In our documentation, we've chosen to use $XCHS as our example token. This is purely for demonstration purposes. However, the principles apply just the same to your chosen token. Just replace $XCHS with your token's name and you're good to go!

```js
{
  'p': 'xchs',
  'op': 'deploy',
  'tick': 'xchs',
  'max': '21000000',
  'lim': '1000'
}
```
